Hall Frontend Challenge - JSON Contact List Importer/Exporter 

Using JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS3, create a web interface that allows a user to enter the first name, last name and phone number of a contact and add them to a list of contacts. 

## Caveats/limitations/exceptions: 
* You CANNOT use JS libraries to complete the task (jQuery/YUI, Backbone, Angular, underscore, etc.). You must use native JS to manipulate the DOM. 
* You CANNOT use a CSS library/framework to complete the task (Bootstrap/Blueprint, etc.) 
* You CAN use JSON.parse/JSON.stringify 
* The final product should be compatible with the latest versions of all major browsers (Chrome, FF, Safari, IE) 

## Features Completed
The interface should be made up of the following: 
* Inputs to add the first name, last name and phone number of a contact 
* An "Add" button for adding the user input to the list of contacts. 
* A "Remove" button for each contact in the list that eliminates the contact's row from the list. 
* An "Export" button which takes the contact list and converts it to JSON 
* A textarea that gets populated with the resulting JSON data after "Export" is clicked 
* An "Import" button that overwrites and populates the list of contacts with contact data manually entered into the textarea if it's properly formatted JSON. 
* Create a fake event tracking function that will capture key user events and log them to a container somewhere on the page. Track whatever events you think help determine whether or not the interface is effective. 

## Bonus Features Completed
* Bonus points are rewarded if the data in the form persists when the user navigates away from the page and comes back 
* Extra bonus points for how the persistent data is stored

## Features Skipped
* Try to show off your knowledge of HTML5 and CSS3 in your implementation. (I will be honest here. I have not done much of it natively. I have used bootstrap/jquery ui to take care of this part for my work but it is limitation in this challenge)

## Bonus Feature Skipped
* Bonus points are rewarded depending on how and if animated transitions are used and implemented in the app (I will be honest here. I have not done much of it natively. I have used bootstrap/jquery ui to take care of this part for my work but it is limitation in this challenge)
